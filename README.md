# Features
* Easily create Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) visualizations
* Choose from numerous color palettes, basemaps, and different configurations

# Overview
QRAGadget is a Shiny Gadget for creating interactive QRA visualizations. QRAGadget is powered by the excellent [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf) packages. While this gadget was initially intended for those interested in creating QRA visualizations, it may also be of use to anyone interested in visualizing raster data in a leaflet map. 

This project is in its *very* early stages. Please let us know if there are things you would like to see (or things you don't like!) by opening up an issue.

# Example
